# OpenMetronome
This is a branch of the Windows metronome program found on openmetronome.sourceforge.net.
My main modifications were to add support for command-line options, allowing you to launch
the program from a batch script or another program with the desired settings.  The other 
mod was to allow beat subdivisions in the custom beat string, so that you can get more 
realistic drum beats.
